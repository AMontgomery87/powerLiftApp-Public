# powerLiftApp-Public
# I'll include updates and proof of concept test code
# Goal is for the app to do the following:
# get max via user input
# generate working weight as a percentage of max
# take pass/fail feedback from user
# take actual weight lifted and generate following lift
# when a given number of failures are recorded, include provisions to switch to different calculations/lifting program
# chart all of lift history into one, easy to read spreadsheet file
# have the ability to set up multiple different lifting day programs to run simultaneously

# I'm tackling one issue at a time as I learn how to code in Python using tutorials
